    "### Permutation:\n",
    "Permutation is the act of arranging the members of a set into a sequence or order, or, if the set is already ordered, rearranging its elementsâ€”a process called permuting. Permutations differ from combinations, which are selections of some members of a set regardless of order.\n",

    "**Write a function, which determines whether one line is a permutation of another. Write an algorithm that optimally finishes the task.**\n",
